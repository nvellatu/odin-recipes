    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>These air-fryer shrimp are perfectly crispy and easy to make without the hassle of heating up a large pot of oil. Serve with our spicy remoulade, or substitute any of your favorite condiments for dipping.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp (16/20 count), peeled and deveined, tails on </li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 large eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the fried shrimp: Spray the basket of a 3.5-quart air fryer with cooking spray and set aside. Pat the shrimp dry between a couple paper towels, then season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper.        </li>
        <li>Whisk the flour with 3/4 teaspoon salt and few grinds of pepper in a shallow bowl or baking dish. Whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt in another shallow bowl. Add the panko to a third shallow bowl. Dip a shrimp in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess, then dip in the beaten eggs. Dredge in the panko, turning until evenly coated. Transfer to a large plate or a rimmed baking sheet and repeat with the remaining shrimp. </li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 385 degrees F. Working in batches, place some of the shrimp in a single layer in the fryer basket, then spray lightly with more cooking spray. Cook until the shrimp are golden brown and cooked through, flipping halfway through, about 10 minutes.  </li>
        <li>For the spicy remoulade sauce: Meanwhile, stir together the mayonnaise, pickled jalapenos, mustard, ketchup, hot sauce and scallion in a small bowl until smooth. Serve with the fried shrimp for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
    <u><b>Chef's Note: </b> </u> You may need to fry the shrimp in 2 to 3 batches, depending on the size of your air-fryer basket.
